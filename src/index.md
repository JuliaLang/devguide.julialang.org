# Introduction

The Julia project thrives on the efforts of it's community to help improve the
project. We'd love to help you get involved too! This guide is a comprehensive
resource for new and experienced contributors alike. There are many more ways to
contribute than just submitting code, all highly valuable and greatly
appreciated üòç.

# Types of contributions

- [Filing an issue](issues.md)
- [Contributing code](code.md)
- [Reviewing submitted pull requests](code.md#reviewing)
- [Proposing changes](proposals.md)
- [Improving the documentation](documentation.md)

# Asking questions

The [discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/) and [zulip
chat](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/register/) are great places to ask
questions. On discourse we have the [new to
Julia](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/first-steps/8) and [General
Usage](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/usage/6) categories, and Zulip has
[#helpdesk](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/225542-helpdesk). We
also have a [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) and an (unofficial)
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/mm2kYjB).

**Please ask questions!** Don't worry about "wasting expert time", contributors
are important to us. If you feel comfortable, it's good to ask questions in
public spaces so others can see the questions and answers, and learn from them
too.

# Code of conduct

We want to maintain a friendly and welcoming environment; all interactions in
official Julia spaces should respect the [community
standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards).
